This guide explains how to build, sign, and distribute the Winder Logbook APK for sideloading installation.

## üîß Build Commands

### 1. Build Release APK
```bash

.\gradlew clean assembleRelease

# APK will be created at:
# app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

### 2. Build Debug APK (for testing)

# Install debug APK
adb install -r app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk

## üîê APK Signing Configuration

The app is already configured with a release signing key:
- **Keystore**: `app/winder-release-key.keystore`
- **Store Password**: `winderlogbook`
- **Key Alias**: `winder-key`
- **Key Password**: `winderlogbook`

**Note**: In production, use a secure keystore and passwords. The current setup is for development/testing.

## üì§ Distribution Process

### For Internal Distribution:

1. **Build the signed release APK**:
   ```bash
   .\gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

2. **Locate the APK**:
   ```
   WinderLogbookGradle\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
   ```

3. **Share via**:
   - Email attachment
   - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
   - USB transfer
   - Network file sharing
   - Company intranet

### For Recipients:

1. **Enable Unknown Sources**:
   - Go to Settings > Security > Unknown Sources

- **USE_FINGERPRINT**: Legacy fingerprint support
- **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**: For local data backup (Android 10 and below)
- **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**: For accessing local files (Android 12 and below)

### Data Security
- All data is encrypted in transit to Firebase
- Biometric authentication protects app access
- Local data is stored securely using Android's secure storage

### Firebase Security
- Firestore rules control data access
- Only authenticated users can read/write data
- Role-based access control implemented

## üìã Installation Instructions for End Users
